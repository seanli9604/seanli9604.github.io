Hi, I'm Sean. Currently, I am a PhD graduand and a recipient of the [Forrest Research Foundation Scholarship](https://forrestresearch.org.au/profiles/wei-ming-sean-li/) at the University of Western Australia, working in the School of Molecular Sciences. My research is in the general area of "cheminformatics", and can be most succinctly described as "computational [mass spectral interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectral_interpretation)". Basically, I apply [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to construct mathematical models, allowing one to convert the problem of "identifying a compound from a mass spectrum" into a set of formal computational problems, which I then solve using various algorithmic and machine learning techniques. By doing this, we can increase both the speed and reliability of compound identification from mass spectrometry, with the end goal of making it possible to identify compounds that cannot be found in a spectral library. Right now, I am also at the very early stages of founding **Moleclue**, a startup in this area, by directly using the algorithms and general expertise I have developed over my PhD to (hopefully) change how mass spectra are analysed in the future. 

Why This Website?
======
I've always enjoyed writing, specifically essays and miscellaneous non-fiction. However, academic writing requires a degree of polish that frustrates me, and in any case I would like to talk about things *outside* of my research. So, starting a blog is almost a no-brainer. Unfortunately, my PhD was all-consuming, to the point where I just kept on putting it off. Now that I am finally done, I would like to get started once and for all. Not to mention, this page makes it easy for me to aggregate personal information (e.g. academic papers, startup-related info, personal essays) all in one spot. 

Another reason why I specifically value semi-formal technical/academic writing is that they fill an important unmet niche. By definition, academic publications (outside of e.g. reviews, which are more circumscribed) must contain novel research assessed as significant by a panel of anonymised reviewers. On the other hand, textbooks or online resources (e.g. Wikipedia) constitute comprehensive summaries of very well-known topics. However, what lies in between those extremes, such as self-contained *summaries* or re-interpretation of specific topics, or brief presentations of technically novel (but insufficiently so for publication) information, can nonetheless be **extremely** useful, and I have personally significantly benefitted from them during my PhD. These pieces of writing are somewhat marginalised though, and end up scattered throughout technical forums and websites (e.g. StackExchange), as well as personal blogs. I guess *technically* I'm not solving this problem by just putting them on a personal blog myself, but nonetheless I hope I can make this problem clearer and highlight the usefulness and informativeness of this form of writing by doing so.
